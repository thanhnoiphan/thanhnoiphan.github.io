## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Geography, [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/de/personen/), Germany, working with [Prof. Dr. Lukas Lehnert](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/people/contact-page/lukas-lehnert-6d3751d4.html) on [“MORE STEP – Mobility at Risk: Sustaining the Mongolian Steppe Ecosystem”](https://www.morestep.org/english3.html), a collaborative, interdisciplinary research project involving Mongolian and German partners, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The project brings together social and ecological sciences to identify societal drivers that may lead to ecological tipping points in the Mongolian steppe ecosystem.

As part of the "Upscaling Vegetation" work package, I develop spatial datasets by integrating satellite imagery, household surveys, interviews, and in situ measurements. I also participate in field campaigns in Mongolia in close collaboration with the Botany Team at the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History Görlitz and the [National University of Mongolia](https://portal.num.edu.mn/en) (including several joint fieldwork campaigns with [Prof. Dr. Karsten Wesche](https://www.senckenberg.de/de/institute/senckenberg-museum-fuer-naturkunde-goerlitz/abt-botanik/sekt-phanerogamen-i/phanerogamen-i-team/)).

Before joining LMU, I was a Research Associate at the [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/), a full-time lecturer and researcher at the [Vietnam National University of Agriculture](https://eng.vnua.edu.vn/), and a Geodesy Engineer at the Geodetic and Topographic Division in Hanoi, Vietnam.

I hold a BSc in Geodesy (2007, [Hanoi University of Mining and Geology](https://humg.edu.vn/en/Pages/home.aspx), Vietnam), an MSc in Natural Resources Management (2012, [Asian Institute of Technology](https://ait.ac.th/), Thailand), and a PhD in Geography (2018, [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/), Germany), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Martin Kappas](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/40585.html).

My research interests lie at the intersection of remote sensing applications, land use/cover change, land system science, and climate change impacts and adaptation. Having worked across disciplines and regions for over a decade, I now aim to apply my technical background toward more impactful, application-oriented, and policy-relevant research that deepens our understanding of how land management and climate change interact to shape ecosystem responses across spatio-temporal scales.
