## About Me
> I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Geography, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU), Germany where I work with [Prof. Dr. Lukas Lehnert](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/people/contact-page/lukas-lehnert-6d3751d4.html) in the [MoreStep](https://www.morestep.org/english3.html) project,  where social and ecological sciences work together to identify societal drivers that can lead to an ecological tipping point of the Mongolian steppe ecosystem. In the MoreStep, I conduct fieldwork in Mongolia and develop spatial datasets that integrate satellite data, household surveys, interviews, and in situ measurements.Our work package (Upscaling Vegetation) collaborates closely with the Botany Team at the Senckenberg Museum für Naturkunde Görlitz (I joined several fieldwork in Mongolia with [Prof. Dr. Karsten Wesche](https://www.senckenberg.de/de/institute/senckenberg-museum-fuer-naturkunde-goerlitz/abt-botanik/sekt-phanerogamen-i/phanerogamen-i-team/)).

Before joining [LMU](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/de/personen/), I was a Research Associate at [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/), a full time lecturer & researcher at [Vietnam National University of Agriculture](https://eng.vnua.edu.vn/), and a Geodesy Engineer (Land/GPS Surveyor) at the Geodetic and Topographic Division, Hanoi, Vietnam. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Geodesy (Vietnam, 2007) from [Hanoi University of Mining and Geology](https://humg.edu.vn/en/Pages/home.aspx), a Master's in Natural Resources Management (Thailand, 2012) from [Asian Institute of Technology](https://ait.ac.th/), and a PhD in Geography from the [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/) (Germany, 2018), under supervison of [Prof. Dr. Martin Kappas](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/40585.html). Over the past decade, my research has focused on remote sensing applications, land system change, climate change impacts and adaptations, and social-ecological dynamics in response to climate change from local to global scales.

After decades several years working on collaborative and interdisciplinary research project, has strengthened my interdisciplinary perspective and reinforced my collaborative spirit. I plan to shift my research focus from primarily technical work (producing high-quality remote sensing datasets and products) to more impactful, application-oriented, and policy-relevant research that helps us better understand the interactions between land management, climate change, and ecosystem responses across scales.
