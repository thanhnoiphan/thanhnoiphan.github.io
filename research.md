### On going project

**MORE STEP – Mobility at risk: Sustaining the Mongolian Steppe Ecosystem** | [Website](https://www.morestep.org/)

This is a collaborative and interdisciplinary research project of Mongolian and German partners funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. 

### Finished project
